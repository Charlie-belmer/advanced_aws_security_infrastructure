# Advanced AWS Security Architecture
This repository is based on my [advanced AWS security series of articles](https://nullsweep.com/advanced-aws-security-architecture/) at nullsweep. 

You will find in this repo CloudFormation templates related to those posts for building out security and application VPC's, security tooling and infrastrucutre, and some custom code for generating and responding to automated security and configuration data.
